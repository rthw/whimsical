    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 14.02.2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how we handle personal data when you use our
      website. We do not collect cookies or track visitors. The only personal
      data we receive is through forms hosted on Fillout.com.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection and Processing</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Data Collected</h3>
    <p>
      We collect the following personal data when you submit a form on
      Fillout.com:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name</li>
      <li>Email address</li>
      <li>Other information provided in the form</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2.2 Hosting Provider</h3>
    <p>
      Our website is hosted on Cloudflare, which may collect technical data such
      as IP addresses for security purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
    <p>We process personal data based on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Consent (provided when you submit a form)</li>
      <li>Legitimate interest (to coordinate workshops)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
      Form data is retained for 12 months unless deletion is requested. We
      periodically review stored data through Fillout.com's interface to remove
      unnecessary information.
    </p>
    <p>
      We ensure all third-party services maintain industry-standard security
      measures, including encryption in transit and at rest.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Fillout.com maintains EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework certification and
      implements Standard Contractual Clauses for data transfers outside the
      EEA/Switzerland.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Disclosures</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell or share personal data with advertisers. Data is only
      shared with essential service providers (Fillout for forms, Cloudflare for
      hosting).
    </p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your location, you may have rights under GDPR (EU), FADP
      (Switzerland), or other privacy laws, including:

      <li>The right to object to data processing.</li>
      <li>The right to data portability.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you wish to exercise these rights, please contact Fillout.com directly,
      as they process form submissions.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may also lodge complaints with your local supervisory authority (EU)
      or the Federal Data Protection Commissioner (Switzerland).
    </p>

    <h2>8. California Residents</h2>
